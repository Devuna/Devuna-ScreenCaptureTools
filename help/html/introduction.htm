<p>Screen Capture/Printing API and Template Specification</p>

<p>The following help file contains descriptions of the functions defined in the SCTOOLS.DLL dynamic-linked library and descriptions of the templates provided to simplify the use of the library.</p>

<p>SCTOOLS.DLL provides a Clarion wrapper for a library (dibapi.dll) of Windows Device-Independent Bitmap (DIB) functions to capture the screen, print bitmaps, convert between bitmap formats, and to display DIBs.  SCTOOLS.DLL also provides a Clarion wrapper for a library (jpgapi.dll) which contains functions for working with compressed jpg image files.  The actual jpg compression is implemented in the Intel JPEG library (ijl15.dll)</p>

<p>The dibapi.dll is a component of the WINCAP sample program, available in the Microsoft Software Library as WINCAP.ZIP.  We have included WINCAP.ZIP in the install set; if you are interested in documentation and source code for dibapi.dll, please choose the 'Custom' setup option.  The source code was originally written in 1992 and is a bit out of date.  We have converted the source code to use current api calls and recompiled using Microsoft Visual C++.  Most procedures in our version of dibapi.dll are th

<p>The Intel JPEG library (IJL) is a software library for application developers that provides high performance JPEG encoding and decoding of full color, and grayscale, continuous-tone still images.  The IJL was designed for use on Intel ® processors-based systems and has been tuned for high performance and efficient memory usage.  Additionally, the IJL was developed to take advantage of MMX ™ technology if present.  The library and documentation are available for download from Intel's developer web site de

<p>The jpgapi.dll is a 32-bit Windows dll written by Devuna to provide a high level 'c' interface to the Intel JPEG library.</p>

<p>To use the Screen Capture Tools library in your application simply add the <a href="sct_initialization_template.htm">SCT_Initialization</a> extension template to the Application Global Extensions and you can begin making calls to the library.  Additional Code and Control Templates are provided to simplify most uses of the library.</p>

<p>A sample program SCT_DEMO.APP is provided that demonstrates use of all of the templates supplied with Screen Capture Tools.</p>
