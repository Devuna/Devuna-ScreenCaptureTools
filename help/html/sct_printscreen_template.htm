<h1 class="bannerBase">SCT_PrintScreen extension template</h1>

<p>The <b>SCT_PrintScreen</b> template adds code to the Application First Procedure to cause the contents of the clipboard or a window to be printed to the default printer when the user presses the PrintScreen Key.  The template also provides an option for a popup menu to allow the user to print, save, or copy the captured image to the clipboard</p>

<p><b>Window to Print</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select one of the choices from the dropdown list.  The choices and their meaning are as follows:</p>

<dl class="indent2">
    <dt>Top Window</dt>
    <dd>the first child window for the application</dd>
    <dt>Application</dt>
    <dd>the application window</dd>
    <dt>DeskTop</dt>
    <dd>the desktop window</dd>
</dl>

<p><b>Print Option</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select one of the choices from the dropdown list.  The choices and their meaning are as follows:</p>

<dl class="indent2">
    <dt>Best Fit</dt>
    <dd>Fits the printed screen on the page in as large of an area as possible while still retaining the correct screen aspect ratio.  The <I>param_wScaleX</I> and <I>param_wScaleY</I> parameters are not used if this option is selected.</dd>
    <dt>Stretch to Page</dt>
    <dd>Stretches the printed screen to fill the entire printed page.  The <I>param_wScaleX</I> and <I>param_wScaleY</I> parameters are not used if this option is selected.</dd>
</dl>

<p><b>Scale</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Scales the printed screen by the integer scaling factors specified in the <I>param_wScaleX</I> and <I>param_wScaleY</I> parameters.  If the scaling is set too large, the screen may extend off the printed page and will be clipped.</p>

<p><b>X Scale</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifies the x-axis scaling factor for the printed window.  The x and y scaling factors are only used if the <b>Scale</b> option above is selected.</p>

<p><b>Y Scale</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifies the y-axis scaling factor for the printed window.</p>

<p><b>X Position</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifies the x-axis origin for the printed window.</p>

<p><b>Y Position</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifies the y-axis origin for the printed window.</p>

<p><b>Use popup menu</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If this option is enabled, a popup window will be presented to the user to allow them to print the captured image to the printer, save the captured image to a disk file, or copy the captured image to the clipboard.  If the <b>DeskTop</b> option is selected for the 'Window to Print' prompt, only the first two popup menu choices are displayed.</p>

<p><b>Compress Image</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If this option is enabled, images saved to disk will be in JPEG format.  If this option is not enabled, images saved to disk will be in DIB format.</p>

<p>This template works by registering the application as a clipboard viewer, subclassing the Application First Procedure window handler, and responding to system generated clipboard messages.</p>
